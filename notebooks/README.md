# Notebooks with demonstrations of the game properties or learning process

This folder contains a set of jupyter notebooks that serve
as the demonstration of the functionality and code:

* `mathematico.ipynb` - Mathematico game, properties, package demonstration
* `mcts_performance.ipynb` - estimation of the performance of pure MCTS
    agent
* `rf.ipynb` - the implementation of the *TD(0)* reinformcement learning
    algorithm, with the connection to *wand* to monitor the progress
    of the learning
* `rf-2.ipynb` - similar to `rf.ipynb`, but the architecture reuses the
    "line" feature extractor, which is also pretrained.
