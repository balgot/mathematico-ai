# Notebooks with demonstrations of the game properties or learning process

This folder contains a set of jupyter notebooks that serve
as the demonstration of the functionality and code:

* `game_properties.ipynb` - Mathematico game, properties, package demonstration
* `mcts_example.ipynb` - example of how to use MCTS to play the game, **Note:
    this example will be removed soon**
* `mcts_performance.ipynb` - estimation of the performance of pure MCTS
    agent
* `td0_RL.ipynb` - the implementation of the *TD(0)* reinformcement learning
    algorithm, with the connection to *wand* to monitor the progress
    of the learning


**Note: `agent.py` contains a (redundant and not performing) definition
of MCTS player and was used to estimate the performance in
`mcts_performance.ipynb`, it is therefore kept here as a reference.**
